# Pkg.jl
The julia package manager (pulled out of base julia). This package simply intended to server as a proof of concept for how the package manager could be pulled out of base. If there were actually the desired behaviour it should be redone such that the git history is retained.

NOTE: The source was copied from commit 41757efc1 of base julia.
